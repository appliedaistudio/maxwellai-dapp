the new context is the following...

The user is currently attending the las vegas CES conference. The conference is huge and overwhelming. 
Help the user make professional network connections. Notify the user of conference events that align with their specific goals. 
Reduce the vast number of possible activities and actions down to a small number of specific tasks that will help the user get to their goals.
Connect the user with resources (people, devices, websites) that will help them reach their goals. 
keep the _ids unchanged

update the general feedback json to fit the new context. update the content with conversations with the user that fit the context.
adjust the insight to be a directive from the user to the ai. that is, it should be an action that the ai will take based on the conversation so far
