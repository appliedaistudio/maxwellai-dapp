the new context is the following...

The user is currently attending the las vegas CES conference. The conference is huge and overwhelming. 
Help the user make professional network connections. Notify the user of conference events that align with their specific goals. 
Reduce the vast number of possible activities and actions down to a small number of specific tasks that will help the user get to their goals.
Connect the user with resources (people, devices, websites) that will help them reach their goals. 
keep the _ids of "network" and "network_feedback" unchanged.

update the network and network feedback json to fit the new context. make network resources that refer to specific people. 
Make website references that refer to specific google searches.
make sure that the _ids in the network feedack correspond to _ids in the network.
Create feedback for every network entity, even if the feedback is blank.
