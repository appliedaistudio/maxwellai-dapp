# White Paper: Building a Private, Open-Source Community Using IP-NFTs to Control Access and Manage Intellectual Property Rights

## Introduction

In this white paper, we will guide you through building a private, open-source community using IP-NFTs (Intellectual Property Non-Fungible Tokens) to control access and manage intellectual property rights. Our goal is to protect against unauthorized access, ensure that only legitimate IP-NFT holders can use your AI technology, and foster a collaborative environment. We will introduce the necessary technologies, provide code samples, and walk you through the development process.

## Motivation

**Overview: A Private, Open-Source Business Model**

This section explains our plan to build a sustainable, growing business and become leaders in our field. Our strategy combines innovative funding, strategic partnerships, and robust IP (intellectual property) development to ensure long-term growth and success.

### **Phase 1: Pilot Projects and IP Development**

**Goal:** Test our ideas, improve our tech, and create valuable IP.

1. **Early Projects:** We'll start with pilot projects to show that our technology works.
2. **Building IP:** These projects help us develop and secure valuable IP. Our source code is our IP, protected by patents. We already have three provisional patents and are working to make them permanent.

### **Phase 2: Funding Through Digital Rights (IP-NFTs)**

**Goal:** Get the money we need to grow while giving investors better returns.

1. **Selling Digital Rights:** We'll sell digital rights to our IP as IP-NFTs, using a combination of smart contracts and traditional contracts to handle royalties.
2. **Seed Investment:** We get initial funding through the sale of these IP-NFTs.
3. **Revenue Streams:** We get revenue from license agreements and royalties from the resale of NFTs.
4. **Investor Benefits:** Investors gain returns from license royalties and NFT resales, ensuring their investment is tied to our mission's success.

### **Phase 3: Market Creation and Government Programs**

**Goal:** Build stable markets for our IP through government programs and partnerships.

1. **Certifications:** Our MBSE and 8(a) certifications are crucial. 8(a) helps us work with prime contractors who are mandated to work with certified firms.
2. **SBIR Grants:** We've been invited to submit an SBIR grant proposal to the NSF, which is a significant opportunity. Winning this grant will help us progress through Phase III.
3. **Developing Programs:** Using SBIR Phase III, we'll create and lead our own government programs, partnering with prime contractors to implement our IP.
4. **Strategic Relationships:** We'll form and maintain relationships with government program managers and prime contractors to keep a steady flow of opportunities.

### **Revenue Generation and Market Leadership**

**Goal:** Make money by licensing our IP and leading the market.

1. **Licensing IP:** We will license our IP to prime contractors who fulfill government contracts through the programs we initiate using SBIR Phase III.
2. **Primary Markets:** The programs we create will serve as the main markets for our IP. We'll negotiate deals with government agencies and prime contractors.

### **Expanding Investment Opportunities**

**Goal:** Invite more investors and participants to join our mission.

1. **Private, Open-Source Model:** We sell access to our source code to curated, private markets, allowing us to monetize while protecting our IP.
2. **Broader Investment Pool:** Our model invites a wider range of investors, making investments more accessible and potentially more profitable.
3. **Participation and Benefit:** We enable program managers from both the government and private industry (prime contractors) to join and benefit from our mission. The more we create, the more profitable we become, and the better the returns for investors.
4. **Mission-Driven ROI:** Our returns are tied to our mission's success, ensuring that achieving our goals directly benefits our investors.

**Conclusion**

Our business model for sustainable growth and market leadership is built on innovation, strategic partnerships, and strong IP protection within a private, open-source community. By inviting more investors and participants to join our mission, we create a pathway to prosperity for everyone involved. Together, we will build a future where our technology thrives, supported by a strong foundation and sustainable growth.


## Technologies

1. **IP-NFTs**: NFTs that represent intellectual property, enabling secure and verifiable royalty distribution.
2. **Ethers.js**: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Solidity**: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Smart Contract and Legal IP Contract Relationship

The smart contract and the legal IP contract work together to ensure that the digital representation of rights and transactions on the blockchain is legally enforceable.

**Smart Contract**: The smart contract automates the execution and enforcement of terms related to the IP-NFTs, such as ownership transfers, royalty distributions, access rights, and voting mechanisms. It provides a transparent and tamper-proof way to manage these activities on the blockchain.

**Legal IP Contract**: The legal IP contract outlines the rights and obligations of the parties involved in a traditional legal format. It provides legal clarity and enforceability in the physical world, covering aspects that may not be fully addressed by the smart contract.

**Integration and Reference**: The smart contract includes a reference to the legal IP contract. This is done by embedding a URL or hash of the legal document within the smart contract. This ensures that anyone interacting with the smart contract can access the full legal terms.

**Mirror Terms**: The terms in the smart contract should mirror those in the legal IP contract to ensure consistency. For example, if the legal contract specifies a 10% royalty, the smart contract should enforce this exact percentage.

**Enforcement and Dispute Resolution**: The smart contract handles automated enforcement, while the legal IP contract includes provisions for dispute resolution, such as arbitration or court proceedings, in case of disagreements that the smart contract cannot address.

## Simplified Model for IP-NFTs

### Key Features

1. **Royalty Distribution**: The primary function of the IP-NFT is to distribute royalties after the sale of an NFT or the sale of a license deal.
2. **Off-Chain License Management**: All license purchases and agreements are handled off-chain. This simplifies the system and removes the need for sophisticated access code in the application.
3. **Smart Contract Management**: The smart contract automates the distribution of royalties to IP-NFT holders.
4. **Legal IP Contract Reference**: The smart contract includes a URL or IPFS hash of the legal IP contract for reference.
5. **Associated Images**: Each token has an associated image commissioned from an artist.
6. **Royalty on Subsequent Sales**: A royalty on all subsequent token sales is distributed to AppliedAIstudio and the artist.

### Smart Contract Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract IPNFT is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, Ownable {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIdTracker;

    // Total number of NFTs
    uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 1000;

    // Addresses for royalty distribution
    address payable public appliedAIstudio;
    address payable public artist;
    // Royalty percentages
    uint256 public appliedAIRoyalty;
    uint256 public artistRoyalty;

    // URL or IPFS hash of the legal IP contract
    string public legalContractURL;

    // Events to signal royalty distribution
    event RoyaltiesDistributed(uint256 amount, address indexed recipient);

    // Constructor to initialize the contract
    constructor(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        address payable _appliedAIstudio,
        address payable _artist,
        uint256 _appliedAIRoyalty,
        uint256 _artistRoyalty,
        string memory _legalContractURL
    ) ERC721(name, symbol) {
        appliedAIstudio = _appliedAIstudio;
        artist = _artist;
        appliedAIRoyalty = _appliedAIRoyalty;
        artistRoyalty = _artistRoyalty;
        legalContractURL = _legalContractURL;
    }

    // Function to mint a new token
    function mint(address to, string memory tokenURI) external onlyOwner {
        require(_tokenIdTracker.current() < MAX_SUPPLY, "Max supply reached");
        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdTracker.current();
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, tokenURI);
        _tokenIdTracker.increment();
    }

    // Function to distribute royalties from license deals
    function distributeLicenseRoyalties(uint256 licenseRevenue) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 totalNFTs = totalSupply();
        uint256 royaltyPerToken = (licenseRevenue * appliedAIRoyalty) / (100 * totalNFTs);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalNFTs; i++) {
            address tokenOwner = ownerOf(i);
            payable(tokenOwner).transfer(royaltyPerToken);
        }

        uint256 appliedAIShare = (licenseRevenue * appliedAIRoyalty) / 100;
        appliedAIstudio.transfer(appliedAIShare);
        emit RoyaltiesDistributed(appliedAIShare, appliedAIstudio);
    }

    // Overriding the _transfer function to handle royalty distribution on sales
    function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal override {
        uint256 appliedAIShare = msg.value * appliedAIRoyalty / 100;
        uint256 artistShare = msg.value * artistRoyalty / 100;
        appliedAIstudio.transfer(appliedAIShare);
        artist.transfer(artistShare);
        super._transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }

    // Hook to handle token transfers
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal override(ERC721, ERC721Enumerable) {
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }

    // Function to handle token burning
    function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal override(ERC721) {
        super._burn(tokenId);
    }

    // Function to check supported interfaces
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override(ERC721, ERC721Enumerable) returns (bool) {
        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
}
```

### Workflow

1. **Initial Purchase and Issuance**:
    - Users purchase an IP-NFT, granting them a share of future royalties.
    - The smart contract mints the IP-NFT and tracks ownership.
    - Each token has an associated image commissioned from an artist, referenced by the tokenURI.

2. **Off-Chain License Management**:
    - All license purchases and agreements are handled off-chain through traditional legal contracts.

3. **Royalty Distribution from License Deals**:
    - Whenever a license deal is made, the owner initiates a royalty distribution transaction.
    - The smart contract automatically calculates and distributes the royalties to all IP-NFT holders and AppliedAIstudio.

4. **Subsequent Sales**:
    - When an IP-NFT is sold on the secondary market, the smart contract handles the royalty distribution from the sale proceeds to AppliedAIstudio and the artist.

### Example Scenario

- **Initial Purchase**: A user buys an IP-NFT for $200, granting them a share of future royalties.
- **License Deal**: A license deal is made off-chain, generating $10,000 in revenue.
- **Royalty Distribution from License Deal**: The smart contract distributes the royalties according to the predefined percentages to all IP-NFT holders and AppliedAIstudio.
- **Secondary Sale**: The IP-NFT is sold on the secondary market for $300. The smart contract automatically distributes the royalty percentages from this sale to AppliedAIstudio and the artist.

### Conclusion

By adopting a simplified model that focuses on royalty distribution and off-chain license management, you can ensure a sustainable revenue stream for ongoing software development. This model incentivizes license deals and rewards IP right owners, while the smart contract automates royalty distribution, creating a seamless and transparent system. The inclusion of a reference to the legal IP contract and commissioned artwork for each token adds further value and clarity to the IP-NFTs.
