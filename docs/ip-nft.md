# White Paper: Building a Private, Open-Source Community Using IP-NFTs to Control Access and Manage Intellectual Property Rights

## Introduction

In this white paper, we will guide you through building a private, open-source community using IP-NFTs (Intellectual Property Non-Fungible Tokens) to control access and manage intellectual property rights. Our goal is to protect against unauthorized access, ensure that only legitimate IP-NFT holders can use your AI technology, and foster a collaborative environment. We will introduce the necessary technologies, provide code samples, and walk you through the development process.

## Motivation

Our strategy is to build a financially sustainable system by starting with pilot projects, also known as early commissions from "Customer Zero," to validate our concepts and refine our technology. These early programs will help us build and release prototypes, creating valuable IP. 

Next, we'll fund our growth by selling tokenized IP through NFTs. These NFTs will be programmed so AppliedAIstudio gets royalties on all sales, providing the capital we need to expand. This funding method also offers investors greater liquidity and faster returns on investment.

With this funding, we'll focus on creating markets through public programs backed by governments. By joining public consortia and being influential within them, we'll secure these programs to establish a stable market for our IP. A core skill will be our ability to position the company effectively in these consortia.

We aim to set up a situation where having a strong pedigree matters. Patents, government certifications, and partnerships will be key differentiators for us. Success depends on our ability to execute these pilot projects, sell the tokenized IP, and secure public programs. This approach offers opportunities that aren't available in the open market and provides a stable, long-term path for growth.

## Technologies

1. **IP-NFTs**: NFTs that represent intellectual property, enabling secure and verifiable access control.
2. **JavaScript Obfuscator**: A tool for obfuscating JavaScript code to make it difficult for users to read or modify.
3. **PouchDB**: A JavaScript database that allows you to store data locally in a browser and synchronize it with a CouchDB server.
4. **Ethers.js**: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
5. **OAuth**: A standard for token-based authentication and authorization.

## Step-by-Step Development Process

### 1. Issuing IP-NFTs

**Design and Mint IP-NFTs**:
- **Choose a Blockchain**: Use a blockchain that supports NFTs, such as Ethereum or another EVM-compatible chain.
- **Minting NFTs**: Create a smart contract that mints 1,000 NFTs with the following features:
  - **Royalty Distribution**: Share sales revenue of the underlying IP among all NFT holders.
  - **Access Control**: Only 100 special tokens grant access to the software through GitHub and allow participation in approving or denying IP license sales through majority voting.
  - **Domain-Specific Collections**: Each collection represents a different application of the AI technology.
  - **Image Association**: Each token has an associated image commissioned from an artist.
  - **Royalties**: AppliedAIStudio receives a percentage of all sales and resales. The artist also receives a percentage of sales and resales.

### Smart Contract and Legal IP Contract Relationship

The smart contract and the legal IP contract work together to ensure that the digital representation of rights and transactions on the blockchain is legally enforceable.

**Smart Contract**: The smart contract automates the execution and enforcement of terms related to the IP-NFTs, such as ownership transfers, royalty distributions, access rights, and voting mechanisms. It provides a transparent and tamper-proof way to manage these activities on the blockchain.

**Legal IP Contract**: The legal IP contract outlines the rights and obligations of the parties involved in a traditional legal format. It provides legal clarity and enforceability in the physical world, covering aspects that may not be fully addressed by the smart contract.

**Integration and Reference**: The smart contract includes a reference to the legal IP contract. This is done by embedding a URL or hash of the legal document within the smart contract. This ensures that anyone interacting with the smart contract can access the full legal terms.

**Mirror Terms**: The terms in the smart contract should mirror those in the legal IP contract to ensure consistency. For example, if the legal contract specifies a 10% royalty, the smart contract should enforce this exact percentage.

**Enforcement and Dispute Resolution**: The smart contract handles automated enforcement, while the legal IP contract includes provisions for dispute resolution, such as arbitration or court proceedings, in case of disagreements that the smart contract cannot address.

### Smart Contract Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract IPNFT is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    // Maximum supply of tokens
    uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 1000;
    // Number of special tokens
    uint256 public constant SPECIAL_SUPPLY = 100;
    // Next token ID to be minted
    uint256 public nextTokenId;
    // Mapping to track special tokens
    mapping(uint256 => bool) public isSpecialToken;

    // Addresses for royalty distribution
    address payable public appliedAIStudio;
    address payable public artist;
    // Royalty percentages
    uint256 public appliedAIRoyalty;
    uint256 public artistRoyalty;

    // URL or IPFS hash of the legal IP contract
    string public legalContractURL;

    // Event to signal license sale approval
    event LicenseSaleApproved(uint256 tokenId, bool approved);

    // Constructor to initialize the contract
    constructor(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        address payable _appliedAIStudio,
        address payable _artist,
        uint256 _appliedAIRoyalty,
        uint256 _artistRoyalty,
        string memory _legalContractURL
    ) ERC721(name, symbol) {
        appliedAIStudio = _appliedAIStudio;
        artist = _artist;
        appliedAIRoyalty = _appliedAIRoyalty;
        artistRoyalty = _artistRoyalty;
        legalContractURL = _legalContractURL;
    }

    // Function to mint a new token
    function mint(string memory tokenURI) external onlyOwner {
        require(nextTokenId < MAX_SUPPLY, "Max supply reached");
        uint256 tokenId = nextTokenId++;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, tokenURI);
        if (tokenId < SPECIAL_SUPPLY) {
            isSpecialToken[tokenId] = true;
        }
    }

    // Function for special token holders to approve license sales
    function approveLicenseSale(uint256 tokenId) external {
        require(isSpecialToken[tokenId], "Not a special token");
        // Implement voting logic here
        emit LicenseSaleApproved(tokenId, true);
    }

    // Hook that is called before any token transfer
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal override(ERC721, ERC721Enumerable) {
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }

    // Function to burn a token
    function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage) {
        super._burn(tokenId);
    }

    // Function to get the token URI
    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage) returns (string memory) {
        return super.tokenURI(tokenId);
    }

    // Function to check supported interfaces
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override(ERC721, ERC721Enumerable) returns (bool) {
        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }

    // Overriding the _transfer function to handle royalty distribution
    function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal override {
        uint256 appliedAIShare = msg.value * appliedAIRoyalty / 100;
        uint256 artistShare = msg.value * artistRoyalty / 100;
        appliedAIStudio.transfer(appliedAIShare);
        artist.transfer(artistShare);
        super._transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Smart Contract

This smart contract, named `IPNFT`, extends the ERC721 standard to create a custom NFT with additional functionalities. The contract mints a maximum of 1,000 tokens, with the first 100 being special tokens that have additional privileges such as voting on IP license sales.

**Key Features**:

- **Minting and URI Setting**: The `mint` function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and assign URIs to them. Tokens are marked as special if their ID is less than 100.

- **Approval of License Sales**: The `approveLicenseSale` function lets special token holders vote on license sales. The voting logic is represented by an event for simplicity.

- **Royalty Distribution**: When tokens are transferred, the `_transfer` function calculates the royalties for AppliedAIStudio and the artist based on predefined percentages and transfers these amounts to their respective addresses. This ensures automatic and transparent royalty distribution.

- **Integration with Legal IP Contract**: The contract includes a reference to the legal IP contract through the `legalContractURL` variable, which stores a URL or IPFS hash of the legal document. This ensures that users interacting with the smart contract are aware of the binding legal terms.

- **Token Management**: Functions such as `_beforeTokenTransfer`, `_burn`, and `supportsInterface` ensure proper token management and compatibility with the ERC721, ERC721Enumerable

, and ERC721URIStorage standards.

### 2. Setting Up Your Environment

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, create a new project directory and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir secure-js-app
cd secure-js-app
npm init -y
```

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install pouchdb ethers javascript-obfuscator
```

### 3. Implementing IP-NFT Verification

Create a JavaScript file (`index.js`) to handle IP-NFT verification using Ethers.js. This script will interact with the Ethereum blockchain to verify ownership and access rights.

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

// Define your contract details
const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const contractAbi = [/* Contract ABI here */];

// Function to check NFT status
async function checkNFTStatus(userAddress, tokenId) {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractAbi, provider);
  const owner = await contract.ownerOf(tokenId);
  const accessDetails = await contract.accessDetails(tokenId);
  const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  
  if (owner.toLowerCase() === userAddress.toLowerCase() && currentTime <= accessDetails.expiration) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

// Example usage
(async () => {
  const userAddress = 'USER_WALLET_ADDRESS';
  const tokenId = 'USER_NFT_TOKEN_ID';
  const hasAccess = await checkNFTStatus(userAddress, tokenId);
  
  if (hasAccess) {
    console.log('Access granted');
  } else {
    console.log('Access denied');
  }
})();
```

### 4. Obfuscating Your Code

To protect your JavaScript code, use the `javascript-obfuscator` package. Create a configuration file (`obfuscator-config.json`):

```json
{
  "compact": true,
  "controlFlowFlattening": true,
  "deadCodeInjection": true,
  "debugProtection": true,
  "debugProtectionInterval": true,
  "disableConsoleOutput": true,
  "identifierNamesGenerator": "hexadecimal",
  "log": false,
  "numbersToExpressions": true,
  "renameGlobals": false,
  "selfDefending": true,
  "simplify": true,
  "splitStrings": true,
  "stringArray": true,
  "stringArrayEncoding": ["rc4"],
  "stringArrayThreshold": 0.75,
  "unicodeEscapeSequence": false
}
```

Run the obfuscation process:

```bash
npx javascript-obfuscator index.js --config obfuscator-config.json --output dist/index.js
```

Your obfuscated code will be in the `dist` directory. Deploy this version to your application.

### 5. Secure Storage and Access Checks

Ensure sensitive data is stored securely and validate access regularly.

**Encrypt Data**:

```javascript
function encryptData(data, key) {
  // Implement encryption logic here (e.g., using CryptoJS)
  return encryptedData;
}

const sensitiveData = 'YOUR_SENSITIVE_DATA';
const encryptionKey = 'YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY';
const encryptedData = encryptData(sensitiveData, encryptionKey);
```

**Periodic Access Check**:

```javascript
setInterval(async () => {
  const userAddress = 'USER_WALLET_ADDRESS';
  const tokenId = 'USER_NFT_TOKEN_ID';
  const hasAccess = await checkNFTStatus(userAddress, tokenId);
  
  if (!hasAccess) {
    alert('Access revoked due to expired or invalid IP-NFT.');
    // Implement additional logic to handle access revocation
  }
}, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Check once a day
```

### 6. OAuth Integration for GitHub Access

Implement OAuth to manage GitHub repository access without requiring server-side components.

**Redirect to GitHub OAuth**:

```javascript
function redirectToGitHubOAuth() {
  const clientId = 'YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID';
  const redirectUri = 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI';
  const scope = 'repo';
  const oauthUrl = `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=${clientId}&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&scope=${scope}`;
  window.location.href = oauthUrl;
}

// Call this function to start the OAuth flow
redirectToGitHubOAuth();
```

**Handle OAuth Callback**:

```javascript
async function handleOAuthCallback() {
  const code = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('code');
  const response = await fetch('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Accept': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      client_id: 'YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID',
      client_secret: 'YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET',
      code: code,
    }),
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  const accessToken = data.access_token;

  // Store access token securely
  localStorage.setItem('github_access_token', accessToken);
}

// Call this function after redirect to handle the OAuth callback
handleOAuthCallback();
```

**Grant GitHub Access**:

```javascript
async function grantGitHubAccess(username) {
  const accessToken = localStorage.getItem('github_access_token');
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/your-username/your-repo/collaborators/${username}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `token ${accessToken}`,
      'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ permission: 'push' })
  });
  return response.ok;
}
```

### Handling Ongoing Innovations and Contributions

**Version Management**:

Use branches or tags in your GitHub repository to manage different versions of the code. The client application can fetch the appropriate version based on the user's IP-NFT rights.

**Automatic Updates**:

Implement a mechanism in the client application to automatically pull updates from the repository when new versions are released.

**Example**:

```javascript
async function checkForUpdates() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/your-username/your-repo/releases/latest', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `token ${localStorage.getItem('github_access_token')}`,
      'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'
    }
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    const latestVersion = data.tag_name;

    if (currentVersion !== latestVersion) {
      // Notify user about the new version and provide update instructions
      alert(`A new version (${latestVersion}) is available. Please update your application.`);
    }
  } else {
    console.error('Failed to check for updates');
  }
}

// Call this function periodically to check for updates
setInterval(checkForUpdates, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Check once a day
```

### Building the Private, Open-Source Community

#### User-Friendly Onboarding and Access Management

**Web-Based Interface**:
- **User Portal**: Develop a web-based portal where users can sign up using traditional email and password authentication. This portal can handle the backend complexities of wallet creation and management.
- **Managed Wallets**: Automatically create and manage crypto wallets on behalf of users. This way, users do not need to interact with wallets directly. Store private keys securely and handle transactions via the backend.

**IP-NFT Issuance**:
- **Simple Purchase Flow**: Allow users to purchase IP-NFTs using traditional payment methods (credit card, bank transfer) through integrated payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- **Non-Crypto Options**: Offer the option to receive IP-NFTs in a custodial wallet managed by the platform.

#### Public Verification Tool

**Ownership Dashboard**:
- **Ownership Overview**: Provide a dashboard where users can see all their IP-NFTs, their ownership details, and expiration dates.
- **Rights Management**: Include features to view and manage usage rights, such as time-limited access, transferability, and licensing terms.

**Public Verification Tool**:
- **Verification Service**: Create a public-facing verification tool where anyone can enter an IP-NFT ID to verify its ownership, authenticity, and rights associated with it.
- **API Access**: Provide an API for external systems to verify ownership and rights programmatically.

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you can implement a secure and user-friendly system to build a private, open-source community using IP-NFTs to control access and manage intellectual property rights. This approach minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, ensures legitimate IP-NFT holders can use your AI technology, and fosters collaboration. While client-side security has its limitations, combining obfuscation with other techniques can significantly enhance the protection of your application.
